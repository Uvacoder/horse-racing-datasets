Horse Racing Datasets [launched in 2015](http://www.raceday360.com/2015/01/28/announcing-horse-racing-datasets/) as an easy way to share and find useable horse racing data.

 {% quote %}
 We’ve been interested in horse racing datasets, and their unfortunate lack of availability, for some time. It’s a time-honored tradition for horseplayers to compile datasets for personal use, but it’s less common for them to share those datasets.

 We started with 10 datasets and are currently at 69 at the launch of this redesign. We gave the site an update [in 2019](http://www.raceday360.com/2019/07/09/updated-site-new-datasets/), and this version aims to build on the improvement of the previous version by improving the speed, usability and accessibility of the site.

## A few enhancements

 * The site is now created with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), a static site generator, which means the site is now very fast. See [the colophon](/colophon/) for a full list of what was used to build this site.
 * There is now pagination on the [All Datasets](/all/) listing.
 * Each dataset now has its own page to make sharing easier.
 * Links now have visible focus states
 * There is a light and dark mode that respects the visitor's system level preference. We have plans to add a toggle to allow for more flexibility.
 * Color contrast in both light and dark modes meets [WCAG AA standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)
 * There are no screen reflow issues at 400% zoom.
 * All information on the site is fully available if JavaScript disabled or fails to load.

We'll continue to add datasets as we find them, and you can always suggest a dataset for inclusion by using our [submission form](https://airtable.com/shrsC21awYkuXap3m).

## Submissions
Our only current criteria, aside from being a dataset about Thoroughbred horse racing, is that the dataset should be in one of the following formats:

* Google Sheet
* CSV
* XSLX
* Spreadsheet at Dropbox
* A raw data format at Github
* Available via API

If you have local CSV or XSLX files you'd like to share, please consider hosting them via [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com), [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) or [Github](https://github.com).

## Credits
The site is designed, built, maintained and conceived by [Dana Byerly](https://danabyerly.com). The idea for the site arose from a [longstanding annoyance](http://www.exactamundo.org/category/data/) with the lack of usable horse racing data and many discussions with [Jessica Chapel](http://jessicachapel.com), who has served as an invaluable sounding board, reviewer of designs and friend of the project!
